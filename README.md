===========

I'm [Karl Dubost](http://www.la-grange.net/karl/).

This is an experiment at a personal Resume on github with contributions open to people who know me.

* [Employment History](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/blob/master/employment.md)
* [Talks and Conferences](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/blob/master/conferences.md)
* [Articles](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/blob/master/publications.md)
* Education (not sure it is relevant)
* [References and Testimonials](https://github.com/karlcow/karl-resume/blob/master/references.md)

The reasoning started with how difficult and misleading it can be sometimes to describe yourself. So I thought about giving only plain facts about my history and let other people contribute on who I was. It means also that this experiment might fail completely. Without trying, we will never know, so let's see where this goes.

I will probably need to create a Makefile, and a template for people who want to contribute to it.
