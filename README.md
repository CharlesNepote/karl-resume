===========

This is an experiment at a personal Resume on github with contributions open to people who know me.

The reasoning started with how difficult and misleading it can be sometimes to describe yourself. So I thought about giving only plain facts about my history and let other people contribute on who I was. It means also that this experiment might fail completely. Without trying, we will never know, so let's see where this goes.
